Over just five days in late July, an exchange of artillery fire, airstrikes and heavy weapons on the Cambodia-Thailand border killed at least 38 people and displaced over 300,000 residents. The initial clash, which began on July 29 near the Preah Vihear temple complex, escalated rapidly as both governments accused each other of violating a 2008 International Court of Justice ruling.

On Day 1, cross-border shelling left several Cambodian soldiers dead. By Day 2, Thai military jets carried out precision strikes on enemy encampments, prompting Cambodia to request immediate support from China. Beijing, eager to project influence, reportedly expedited deliveries of rockets and artillery shells to Phnom Penh.

Day 3 saw diplomatic efforts intensify. ASEAN’s secretary-general called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, but neither side budged. Instead, Thai special forces launched a night raid to recover hostages, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.

Day 4’s footage of civilian villages ablaze went viral, drawing condemnation from human rights groups. UN agencies warned of a growing humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands seeking shelter in makeshift camps across both borders.

By Day 5, Moscow-mediated talks began in Vientiane. Russia offered to broker a bilateral ceasefire, citing concerns over Western influence. The crisis subsided temporarily, but the underlying territorial dispute remains unresolved, raising questions about ASEAN’s cohesion and the intensifying involvement of major powers in Southeast Asia.

PHNOM PENH — The Royal Thai Army has signaled that planned border negotiations with Cambodia could be postponed unless Cambodian civilians evacuated from frontline villages are returned to their homes, a senior Thai military official said on Friday.

Since clashes reignited on October 1 near the Dangrek Mountains, more than 20,000 Khmer villagers have fled their homes amid repeated artillery barrages. Thailand’s army chief, General Anurak Phothikum, told reporters that his government will refuse to sit at the table until Cambodia ensures the safe return of non-combatants.

“We are ready to talk peace, but first we demand that all displaced Cambodians be allowed back under neutral supervision,” Gen. Anurak said. “Their removal was used strategically to shield military positions, and that must end before any meaningful dialogue occurs.”  

Cambodian officials dismissed the claim, accusing Bangkok of using humanitarian concerns as a pretext to stall talks. “We have provided daily humanitarian corridors,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sok Samnang. “It is Thailand that continues shelling, preventing our people from returning.”

Analysts warn that failure to commence talks could further inflame tensions. ASEAN observers are scheduled to arrive in Siem Reap next week for a fact-finding mission. Meanwhile, the United Nations has called on both sides to halt military operations and resume negotiations immediately.

BANGKOK — Thailand’s National Security Council (NSC) convened an emergency meeting on Thursday to finalize a classified operation aimed at countering what it described as “aggressive maneuvers” by Cambodian forces along the northern border.

Citing intelligence reports, NSC secretary-general Wichai Worachai disclosed that Phnom Penh had positioned three infantry battalions within 500 metres of several border checkpoints. “This level of incursion is unprecedented,” Wichai said. “The NSC has approved contingency plans, including targeted strikes and electronic surveillance, should diplomatic channels fail.”

The session included generals from all military branches, senior diplomats and National Police chief Pol Gen Somchai Thepsuthin. There was debate over whether to authorize cross-border raids or rely on Asean mediation, which Cambodia supports. The more hawkish members argued that show-of-force operations would deter further encroachments.

Opposition lawmakers criticized the secrecy, calling for parliamentary oversight. “The Thai people deserve transparency when our soldiers’ lives are at stake,” said MP Chularat Siriwat of the Move Forward Party. Human rights groups expressed concern over potential civilian casualties.

In Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Hun Sen’s office denied any plans to invade Thai territory. A spokesperson called the Thai allegations “baseless” and suggested that internal politics in Bangkok were fueling the NSC briefing. Meanwhile, border communities on both sides remain under high alert as troops mass for what could become the most serious military standoff in decades.

## Article 4: Thailand will not reopen Cambodia border anytime soon, Thai army says

BANGKOK — Thailand’s military has ruled out reopening its border crossings with Cambodia in the immediate future, citing ongoing security risks and threats of renewed skirmishes along the frontier.

In a statement released Friday, the Royal Thai Army’s spokesperson, Col. Worawat Sirisopha, said that all five major crossing points—from Aranyaprathet–Poipet to Chong Sa-Ngam–Samrong—will remain closed until further notice. “Our primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of our citizens. Until tensions subside, border gates will stay shut,” the statement read.

The border has been sealed since late July, when artillery exchanges near the Preah Vihear temple escalated into a weeklong conflict. Despite a temporary ceasefire brokered by Russia and Indonesia in August, smaller skirmishes have persisted.

Economic fallout has been severe, with bilateral trade dropping 40% in September. Local businesses on both sides complain of lost revenue and supply-chain disruptions. “My factory can’t get raw materials from Thailand, and my workers can’t commute back,” said Kim Sothea, owner of a wood-processing plant near Battambang.

ASEAN foreign ministers are due to meet next week in Vientiane. Observers hope they will press for a durable ceasefire and propose a multilateral monitoring mechanism. But with both militaries entrenched and nationalist sentiment high, experts caution that diplomatic breakthroughs may be elusive.

## Article 5: China denies any interest in the Thai-Cambodian conflict after it was revealed Chinese arms were used

BANGKOK — China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed allegations Friday that Beijing has a stake in the Cambodia-Thailand border war, a day after evidence emerged showing Chinese-manufactured rockets were fired by Cambodian forces.

Spokesperson Liu Wei told a press briefing, “China is firmly committed to peace and stability in Southeast Asia. We do not supply weapons for the purpose of fueling conflicts between our neighbors.” Liu added that any arms purchases by Cambodia were part of standard military procurement processes.

Investigative reporters from The Bangkok Post obtained shipping manifests indicating that Cambodia received a shipment of Type-63 107mm multiple rocket launchers in early June. Analysts say these artillery systems have proven capable of delivering both high-explosive and cluster munitions.

Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha summoned China’s ambassador to lodge a formal protest. “We demand transparency regarding the origin and end-user certificates of these weapons,” the Prime Minister’s office said in a statement.

Beijing’s denial did little to assuage regional concerns. ASEAN foreign ministers have repeatedly urged major powers to refrain from arming either side. “The spillover risk is real,” said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a regional security expert at Kyoto University. “If China continues to supply arms discreetly, it will only prolong the conflict and destabilize the Mekong subregion.”

Meanwhile, villagers on both sides complain that sophisticated Chinese munitions make the war deadlier and harder to predict, raising the specter of a prolonged stalemate unless external actors step back.
